## About the dataset
Credit card fraud is one of the most common online scams. Credit card numbers, PINs, and security codes can be easily stolen and used to make fraudulent transactions. This can cause huge financial losses for traders and consumers. However, credit card companies are ultimately obligated to reimburse their customers for any losses. Therefore, it is extremely important that credit card companies and other financial institutions can detect fraud before it occurs.

## Problem Statement:
A credit card is one of the most used financial products to make online purchases and payments. Though the Credit cards can be a convenient way to manage your finances, they can also be risky. Credit card fraud is the unauthorized use of someone else's credit card or credit card information to make purchases or withdraw cash.
It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. 
The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.
We have to build a classification model to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.
